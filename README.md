# Project Title

Smart contracts used in data selling demo.

## General discription

This repository shows the source code of smart contracts that we are using in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyVwQz6EV54) demo video. The instances of CustomToken and MicroRaidenRightMeshChannels smart contracts are deployed at [0x0fc373426c87f555715e6fe673b07fe9e7f0e6e7](https://kovan.etherscan.io/address/0x0fc373426c87f555715e6fe673b07fe9e7f0e6e7) and [0x0f1736fa3eb54bd8c234725bd658201da0b4190d](https://kovan.etherscan.io/address/0x0f1736fa3eb54bd8c234725bd658201da0b4190d), respectively.

## Note

The deployed CustomToken and MicroRaidenRightMeshChannels addresses are used as a part of our [RightMesh](https://developer.rightmesh.io/register_form.php) library. 
Since applications running atop RightMesh library, the [Superpeer](https://github.com/RightMesh/Superpeer) does not work with other deployed smart contract instances.
